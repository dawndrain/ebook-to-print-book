<h1 id="interview-with-the-frost-giant"><strong>Interview With The Frost Giant</strong></h1>
<p>So describe for us what it’s like to be a frost giant.</p>
<p><em>See, I think that’s totally the wrong way to look at it. It’s as if all of my experience is determined by this one unitary fact of being a frost giant, so that I can just take something from my life and say “Yeah, that’s what frost giants are”. Being a frost giant is a lot like being anything else. So I guess part of being a frost giant, part of what it’s like to be a frost giant, is to know that other people are going to judge you just because you’re a frost giant.</em></p>
<p>So you feel like you encounter a lot of discrimination?</p>
<p><em>Nothing too obvious. I mean, no one tries to beat me up or burn my house down. It’s just the little things. Like people always assume that, just because I’m a frost giant, I must be part of the dread hell-legions of Niflheim. And I mean, yeah, sure, some frost giants are part of the dread hell-legions of Niflheim, but some white people are part of the dread hell-legions of Niflheim, and some black people, and some Mexican people. But if you saw a Mexican on the street, you wouldn’t automatically assume he wanted to cover the world in an apocalypse of ice.</em></p>
<p>But you are a warrior in the dread hell-legions of Niflheim, aren’t you?</p>
<p><em>Well, sure, I am. It’s a decent job. And a lot of Jews are bankers, but that doesn’t mean that you can assume every Jew you see is a banker and you’ll never be wrong. There are frost giants in every occupation you can imagine. Teacher. Plumber. Manager. Nurse. Actor. Scientist.</em></p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p><em>Well, no, not nurse. Our icy touch is fatal to all but the mightiest of heroes. But the others? Sure. Tyler was a hedge fund manager.</em></p>
<p>Tyler?</p>
<p><em>My older brother. Does it surprise you that he’s named Tyler, and not some more traditional name like Grimhavr or Skurjklas? My family has been in this country over a hundred years. We’ve assimilated along with everyone else. My grandfather on my mother’s side is named Einvrehemir, but my mother is Susan, and my father is Paul.</em></p>
<p>What do you think are the biggest misconceptions about frost giants?</p>
<p><em>Well, most of the time when flesh midgets see us, they…</em></p>
<p>Sorry, flesh midgets?</p>
<p><em>Heh, my personal little joke. I mean, when you call us frost giants, it’s like you’re painting us as freaks, as if our only two interesting characteristics are being made of a different substance than you, and being of a different height than you. So when I call you flesh midgets, it’s like - the boot is on the other foot, you know?</em></p>
<p>So do you consider the term ‘frost giant’ offensive?</p>
<p><em>Oh, no. I’m not one of those people. For a while, Tyler insisted on people saying ‘ice-person of unusual stature’, but that’s such a mouthful. No, it might not be the best term, but it’s the one people use. I just say ‘flesh midget’ to, like, raise awareness, make people think.</em></p>
<p>Anyway, I’m sorry. You were talking about the biggest misconceptions about frost giants.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. So most of the time when people see us, it’s on a TV special about Ragnarok, or when we go door to door gathering toenails for the horrible corpse-boat Naglfar, or best case because one of us runs the local sno-cone stand. And so people only view us as apocalypse-bringers, or nail-boat-sailors, or sno-cone vendors, and not as fathers and mothers and co-workers and just normal people. Even in modern liberal society, when a TV show can have a black person or a Jewish person as a main character, the frost giant is pretty much always depicted as an axe-wielding servant of Niflheim trying to kill the Norse gods.</em></p>
<p>Well, black people and Jewish people still look more or less like everyone else. You’re eighteen to twenty-five feet tall and made of solid ice.</p>
<p><em>As my mother used to say, it’s not the size of the person that matters, it’s the size of the heart.</em></p>
<p>Don’t frost giants have ice instead of blood, and a shard of obsidian in their chest instead of a heart?</p>
<p><em>It’s metaphorical. Heart is supposed to mean, like, your ability to care for other people.</em></p>
<p>And frost giants do care for other people. Tell us about some of the activism work that frost giants are involved in.</p>
<p><em>Oh, we’re involved in pretty much every cause. Poverty, education, medical research, the environment, global warming…</em></p>
<p>Global warming?</p>
<p><em>I see where you’re going with this. You want me to say that frost giants are disproportionately involved in the fight against global warming because we’re made of ice, and so we have some sort of hokey “kinship” with the cold. Well, I hate to burst your bubble, but frost giants are involved in the</em></p>
<p><em>fight against global warming for the same reason as people of all races and nationalities: because we live in a fragile world which is worth protecting.</em></p>
<p>But you do melt at temperatures greater than 46 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. That was what happened to Tyler.</em></p>
<p>I think we’re almost out of time here. Any final words?</p>
<p><em>Please don’t title this something like “Interview With The Frost Giant”. Title it “Interview With A Father of Three”, or “Interview With Tyler’s Younger Brother”, or “Interview With The Chief Warrior of the Third Dread Legion of Niflheim”, or anything that shows that I’m an individual, and not just a representative of some generic Other.</em></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><em>You’re welcome.</em></p>
