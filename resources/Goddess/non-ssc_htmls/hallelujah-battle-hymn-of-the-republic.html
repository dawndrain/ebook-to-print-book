<p><strong>(to the tune of Hallelujah by Leonard Cohen)</strong></p>
<p>Mine eyes have seen the glory of The coming of the Lord above He’s got some grapes of wrath He’s gonna brew ya He’s loosed the fateful lightning stored Within his terrible swift sword Truth’s marching, glory glory hallelujah! Hallelujah, hallelujah Hallelujah, hallelujah</p>
<p>I’ve seen Him in a hundred camps They’ve built an altar in the damps And where the chill of evening passes through ya I’ve read his righteous sentence in The lights that flare both bright and dim His day comes, glory glory hallelujah! Hallelujah, hallelujah Hallelujah, hallelujah</p>
<p>I read a Gospel writ in steel God sees how you with sinners deal And as you do to them, His grace will do ya Let hero born of woman crush The serpent hidden in the brush God’s marching, glory glory hallelujah! Hallelujah, hallelujah Hallelujah, hallelujah</p>
<p>He’s sounded forth the trumpet call That never knows retreat at all And from His judgment seat He’s gonna view ya Be swift my soul his call to meet Be jubilant, my legs and feet God’s marching, glory glory hallelujah! Hallelujah, hallelujah Hallelujah, hallelujah</p>
<p>Beside the lilies, Christ was born Amidst the beauty of the morn With glory in His bosom to renew ya And as He died in saving me So I will die to make men free God’s marching, glory glory hallelujah! Hallelujah, hallelujah Hallelujah, hallelujah * <strong>(to the tune of Battle Hymn of the Republic)</strong></p>
<p>I heard there was a secret chord that David used to play But you don’t really care for anything I have to say It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth, and so on in this way He just kept playing on!</p>
<p>The baffled king composing Hallelujah! The baffled king composing Hallelujah! The baffled king composing Hallelujah! He just kept playing on!</p>
<p>Your faith in God was strong and yet you felt you needed proof You saw the moonbeams dancing as she bathed upon the roof She tied you to a kitchen chair, she cut your hair, and - oof! She drew it from your lips!</p>
<p>From your lips the Hallelujah! From your lips the Hallelujah! From your lips the Hallelujah! She drew it from your lips!</p>
<p>You say that I have tried to take the Name of God in vain But really to be honest I don’t even know the Name A blaze of light in every word, I guess they’re all the same. It doesn’t matter which!</p>
<p>The holy or the broken Hallelujah! The holy or the broken Hallelujah! The holy or the broken Hallelujah! It doesn’t matter which!</p>
<p>It might not have been much, but still I tried to do my best And even though it all went wrong, I feel that I’ve been blessed And if I meet the Lord of Song when I am laid to rest That’s all I’ll have to say!</p>
<p>I will tell Him Hallelujah! I will tell Him Hallelujah! I will tell Him Hallelujah! That’s all I’ll have to say!</p>
