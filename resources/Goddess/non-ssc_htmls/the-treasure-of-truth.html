<p>There is a sign before a cavern, in Niorve in the Thousand Nadirs. It is written in the star-symbols that people wrote in before they learned the Perfect Language, and it says:</p>
<p>“Truth placed a treasure in this cavern. It belongs to any who have enough faith in him to heed the message he placed here, and turn right at the crossroads. But the Lords of Noise, to keep men from the treasure, placed a ghost at the crossroads, whose job it is to urge men to turn left. The ghost is more clever than men think, and their faith weaker. Beware, for if you turn left you will die.”</p>
<p>Many people entered the cave seeking the treasure, sure their faith was strong enough. None ever came out.</p>
<p>Kadmi Rachumion came to the cave when he was clearing the land of mysteries. For three days he fasted and meditated in front of it. Then he called down the Perils of the Northern Lights and asked them to test his faith. For another three days they tested it, and finally they told him that no power in human lands or the ultimate north could move him, because his resolution was perfect.</p>
<p>Then he lit a torch, entered the cavern, and walked down a long corridor. As he walked, he thought of how the ghost might tempt him. Money he could refuse. Power he could refuse. Threats he would shrug off. Arguments he would dissect. Reason he would meet with reason. And he held the Spear That Burns Illusion before him, so no trickery could confound his path.</p>
<p>Finally he came to the crossroads, and there stood a ghost, dressed in the rags of Shinomai. “Go on,” he told the ghost. “Try your best.”</p>
<p>The ghost said: “Truth placed a treasure in this cavern. It belongs to any who have enough faith in him to heed the ghost he left to lead them, and turn left at the crossroads. But the Lords of Noise, to keep men from the treasure, placed a sign in front of the cavern, whose job it is to urge men to turn right. Beware, for if you turn right you will die.”</p>
<p>Kadmi thought for a long time, then laughed. Then he made the sign of Kasi Elution Lighting The Sun Beacon, and the ghost disappeared. Then he turned around and walked out of the cave.</p>
<p><strong>Niderion-nomai’s commentary:</strong> Kadmi won the treasure, which was Invincible Doubt.</p>
