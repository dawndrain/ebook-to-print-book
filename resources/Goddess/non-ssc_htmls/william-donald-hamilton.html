<p>How does a selfish genome, evolved over eons Of survival of the fittest, in a contest to the finish With Nature red in tooth and claw, perpetually clashing End up producing altruism and compassion?</p>
<p>The ultimate conclusion to this crux of evolution Cutting straight through the confusion, took a brilliant contribution From a genius in collusion with a top-notch institution To tie the threads together and arrive at a solution</p>
<p>And every day, unknown, in destitution Away in a library he toiled in seclusion Inside, he was longing to cut through the illusion Gonna figure out life’s secrets, gonna start a revolution!</p>
<p>Then an insight came, the rule that bears his name If you grow up in a family your genes are half the same Reproduction of the bloodline, not the body, is the aim. You gotta placate Darwin, but you’re gonna shift the frame</p>
<p>Well, the word got around, they said this kid is insane, man Look at all the mysteries that we can now explain, man Gotta go to Oxford and develop that huge brain, man And the world’s gonna know your name - what’s your name, man?</p>
<p>William Donald Hamilton My name is William Donald Hamilton And there’s a million things I can’t explain But just you wait… just you wait</p>
<p>When he was thirty-four he saw, how the law, of relation Applied to hymenoptera, produced cooperation By degree, can’t you see, how the key’s the queen bee And at a stroke, he understood eusociality</p>
<p>Moved on to America and set up shop in Michigan Turned to herd behavior and he studied bugs and fish again Why they move in groups instead of fending for themself Started uniting, rewriting every treatise on the shelf</p>
<p>There would have been nothing left to do For someone less ambitious But he turned from bugs and fishes To why creatures act malicious They were noting, devoting time to acts of resistance Against conspecifics signaling a high genetic distance</p>
<p>Combining, redefining every field he gets his hands on Changing times, paradigms, see him now as he stands on The brink of a revolution sweeping zoology With Darwin, we can rewrite biology!</p>
<p>(with Darwin, we can rewrite biology…with Darwin, we can rewrite biology…)</p>
<p>William Donald Hamilton We are waiting in the wings for you You could never back down You never learned to take your time!</p>
<p>Oh, William Donald Hamilton When biology sings for you Will they know how much work it took? Will they know you rewrote the book? So many places still to look, oh He’s headed to the Congo now, a final expedition Just another scientist, going on a mission Overturning certainties and breaking with traditions</p>
<p>But me? I taught him Me? I worked with him Me? I learned from him Me? I challenged him And all our genes follow his conditions</p>
<p>There’s a million things I can’t explain, But just you wait. What’s your name man?</p>
<p>William Donald Hamilton!</p>
