# Hallelujah/Battle Hymn Of The Republic
**(to the tune of Hallelujah by Leonard Cohen)**

Mine eyes have seen the glory of
The coming of the Lord above
He’s got some grapes of wrath He’s gonna brew ya
He’s loosed the fateful lightning stored
Within his terrible swift sword
Truth’s marching, glory glory hallelujah!
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

I’ve seen Him in a hundred camps
They’ve built an altar in the damps
And where the chill of evening passes through ya
I’ve read his righteous sentence in
The lights that flare both bright and dim
His day comes, glory glory hallelujah!
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

I read a Gospel writ in steel
God sees how you with sinners deal
And as you do to them, His grace will do ya
Let hero born of woman crush
The serpent hidden in the brush
God’s marching, glory glory hallelujah!
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

He’s sounded forth the trumpet call
That never knows retreat at all
And from His judgment seat He’s gonna view ya
Be swift my soul his call to meet
Be jubilant, my legs and feet
God’s marching, glory glory hallelujah!
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Beside the lilies, Christ was born
Amidst the beauty of the morn
With glory in His bosom to renew ya
And as He died in saving me
So I will die to make men free
God’s marching, glory glory hallelujah!
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

I heard there was a secret chord that David used to play
But you don’t really care for anything I have to say
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth, and so on in this way
He just kept playing on!

The baffled king composing Hallelujah! The baffled king composing Hallelujah!
The baffled king composing Hallelujah! He just kept playing on!

Your faith in God was strong and yet you felt you needed proof
You saw the moonbeams dancing as she bathed upon the roof
She tied you to a kitchen chair, she cut your hair, and - oof!
She drew it from your lips!

From your lips the Hallelujah! From your lips the Hallelujah!
From your lips the Hallelujah! She drew it from your lips!

You say that I have tried to take the Name of God in vain
But really to be honest I don’t even know the Name
A blaze of light in every word, I guess they’re all the same.
It doesn’t matter which!

The holy or the broken Hallelujah! The holy or the broken Hallelujah!
The holy or the broken Hallelujah! It doesn’t matter which!

It might not have been much, but still I tried to do my best
And even though it all went wrong, I feel that I’ve been blessed
And if I meet the Lord of Song when I am laid to rest
That’s all I’ll have to say!

I will tell Him Hallelujah! I will tell Him Hallelujah!
I will tell Him Hallelujah! That’s all I’ll have to say!
