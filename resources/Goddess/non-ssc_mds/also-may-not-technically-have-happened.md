# **Also May Not, Technically, Have Happened**

The man bumped into me, knocked the wind out of me, and then apologized a second later.

“Sorry!” he said. Then he stopped, thought a second. “By the way, you don’t know where I could find a decent Indian restaurant around here, do you?”

“Actually, there’s one just a few minutes that way,” I told him. “I’m heading that direction myself. You can follow me if you want, I’ll point it out to you.”

“Oh, thanks.” He held out one of his six blue hands, which I reluctantly shook. “I’m Mahaksuryana. Pleased to make your acquaintance.”

“This is kind of going to be a weird question,” I said, “but are you a Buddhist god?”

“Hindu, actually,” said Mahaksuryana, “but I’m not offended. I like the Buddhists. They’re pretty chill.”

“I’m... not sure they’d let you into a restaurant, looking like that,” I said. “Or, well, they might, but you’d pick up a lot of unwanted attention.”

He closed his eyes for a second, and clasped his hands in a posture of infinite inner peace. His blue skin changed to a dusky brown, and four of his six arms vanished. I began walking, and he followed.

“Sorry,” he said. “It’s been a long time since I’ve been down here. You’ve kind of screwed the place up, no offense.”

“None taken,” I said. “We humans haven’t always been perfect stewards of our planet, but I do think that —”

“I mean,” continued Mahaksuryana, “we told you lot not to eat cows. But would you listen?”

“What? What does eating cows have to do with all of this?”

The Hindu god sighed. “Think about it. The number of living humans increases every generation. A hundred fifty years ago there were only a billion humans. Now there are seven billion.

“We’re supposed to reincarnate the souls of the dead into new bodies, but there just aren’t enough souls to deal with the population explosion. That’s not even counting the virtuous who achieve enlightenment and break the cycle of reincarnation, or the wicked who have to be reincarnated as cockroaches for an aeon as just desert for their sins.

“We used to have procedures for something like this. The most virtuous animals would be reincarnated as human. Usually it would be some courageous tiger or some especially clever monkey or something, or a war elephant who served his master well.

“But now you’ve cut down the jungles and drained the swamps and there just aren’t a whole lot of monkeys and tigers running around. In fact, the only large animals with complex nervous systems that continue to exist in numbers even remotely similar to those of humans are your farm animals. Not to mention they’re conveniently located in large human habitations. If we need a soul in central Iowa, stat, no way we’re going to go looking for the last remaining population of wild tigers in Bangladesh.

“So the overwhelming majority of your people were farm animals in their past lives.

“But think about how you treat your farm animals. Factory farming. Force fed through tubes so their diet can be precisely controlled. Locked in cages exactly the size of their bodies to prevent them from using their muscles lest the meat become less tender. Separated at birth from their families. Never seeing the sun or the green grass. Pumped full of drugs so they can be packed side-to-side in vast warehouses without infection.

“And then your children are born, and almost from birth they start to go wrong. Stuffing themselves full of food and avoiding exercise. Isolated from their families and each other. Retreating from nature and the open spaces to watch television in dark rooms. Stuffing themselves full of drugs, from alcohol to cocaine, in an attempt to make themselves feel better.

“And your psychiatrists write in their journals about how rates of depression, autism, and attention deficit disorder are increasing by orders of magnitude each generation, and they don’t know why.”

“Honestly, sometimes I can’t blame Kali for just wanting to destroy the whole thing and start over. I guess she’ll get her way soon eno—

—oh, look, there’s the Indian restaurant! And it looks delicious!”

And with divine precision the Hindu god Mahaksuryana bowed, did a perfect quarter turn, and stepped through the door. I would have followed, but I was in a hurry, and something warned me to stay away.

I never saw Mahaksuryana again, and honestly that’s just fine by me.”
