# Chopping Feet Off Sonnet 18
(original by William Shakespeare)

Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed,
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature's changing course untrimmed:
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,
Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

O, thou art like a summer’s day
But fairer and more temperate
Rough winds do shake the buds of May
And summer hath too short a date.
Sometimes too hot the sunlight shines
And sometimes is its color dimmed
And every fair from fair declines
By chance, or nature’s course, untrimmed.
But thy own summer shall not fade
Nor shalt thou lose the fair thou ow'st
Nor shalt Death have thou in his shade
In timeless lines to Time thou growst.
So long as men can breathe or see,
So long lives this, and through it, thee.

A summer’s day?
No, you’re more fair!
There’s storms in May
And sunshine’s rare.
The sky’s too bright
Or else too dim;
All charms take flight
By nature’s whim.
But you won’t fade,
Nor lose your fair,
Nor reach death’s shade;
These lines will spare!
If men still see,
This poem’s for thee.

\*

Nice day?
No, you!
Storms spray
Spring too.
It’s warm
Or cold.
And charm
Gets old.
You’ll not
Decline;
You’ve got
This line.
Men here?
You’re clear.
